# java-boiler-craft plugin
This project aims to enhance the efficiency of code writing by automatically generating boilerplate code.
The main feature of this plugin

<ul>
    <li>generation of boilerplate code for MockMvc tests for RestDocs.</li>
    <li>generate constructors and builder patterns for a given class.</li>
</ul>

When you input a class name and uses a dot,
or on the Generate menu, in test scope,
you can select RestController class and methods.
Then the plugin automatically generates boilerplate code for MockMvc tests for RestDocs.

And You can choose between 'All Args Constructor' and 'Builder Completion'.
If 'All Args Constructor' is selected, a constructor containing all parameters is automatically generated.
If 'Builder Completion' is selected, the code with the builder pattern is generated.

This eliminates the need for the user to manually write each constructor or implement the builder pattern.
